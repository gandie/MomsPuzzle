# momspuzzle

One of these little projects done simply because i can.

My mom plays puzzle games on her tablet. This one caught my
attention, it's like Towers of Hanoi but with colors and
more poles. Still the [puzzle solver Raymond Hettinger](https://youtu.be/_GP9OpZPUYc?si=sX6XNyhGzb6RLWla&t=433) once
presented to me should do the trick quite easily. Maybe we
even add some sweet visuals in order to explain the difficulty
of such puzzles. In my rommantic brain we can even explore our
own ability to solve such puzzles and show the magic of the
human mind as we're sometimes able to take magic shortcuts in
the huge graphs we're often confronted with while solving
puzzles or making decisions in general. Well, what a colorful
docstring this is. Enough cheap talk. Let's implement mom's
stupid puzzle for good.
